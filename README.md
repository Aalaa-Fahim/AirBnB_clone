# Airbnb Clone Project

This project is a collaboration between Aalaa Fahim and Reham Saeed, cohort 19 students of ALX Software Engineering using the Holberton School curriculum. An Airbnb clone project aims to replicate some of the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the application and performing various actions such as creating and managing user accounts, listing properties, booking stays, and more.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a Python-based interface that allows users to interact with the Airbnb clone application through a series of commands. It provides a convenient way to manage and manipulate data within the application.

### How to Start

To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to start the command interpreter:

   ```
   $ python3 console.py
   ```

### How to Use

Once the command interpreter is running, you can use various commands to interact with the application. Here are some of the available commands:

- `help`: Display a list of available commands and their descriptions.
- `create <classname>`: Create a new instance of the specified class (e.g., `create User`).
- `show <classname> <id>`: Display information about the specified instance (e.g., `show User 123`).
- `update <classname> <id> <attribute> <value>`: Update the specified attribute of an instance (e.g., `update User 123 name "John Doe"`).
- `all <classname>`: Display all instances of the specified class (e.g., `all User`).
- `destroy <classname> <id>`: Delete the specified instance (e.g., `destroy User 123`).
- `quit`: Exit the command interpreter.

Please refer to the documentation or use the `help` command within the interpreter for a complete list of available commands and their usage.

Feel free to explore the different commands and functionalities of the Airbnb clone project using the command interpreter.
